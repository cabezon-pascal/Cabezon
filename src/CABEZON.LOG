Maintenance history

    Ver 0.01    '90/08/22

    - Initial version release

    Ver 0.02    '90/10/28

        - Implemented a case statement
        - Implemented with statement
        - Implemented goto statement
            - Name can be used for goto label
              (ex.  goto exitMainLoop; )
            - It is possible to go to go through the procedure

        - Implemented for-every statement
        - In the for statement, no error occurs even if the expression type is different from the control variable.
            Fixed a bug

    Ver 0.03    '91/02/20

        - Implemented procedure new / dispose
        - Implemented the following procedure to support text type

                assign, reset, rewrite, close, read, readln, write, writeln,
                eof

        - Improved the display method of run-time errors. Error code and error address
            Was displayed.
        - When outputting an integer value in the write procedure, if the width is not specified, the negative value My
            Fixed a bug that eggplant is not output.
        - Fixed that readln with no argument was an error.
        - Corrected an error in the handling of label symbols. Removed from hash table
            It wasn't removed.
        - Modify the compiler driver and assemble after compiling and assembling.
            Changed to delete the assembly language program. However, assemble
            If only, do not delete.

    Ver 0.04    '91/03/17

        - Implemented the string concatenation operator'+' and the embedding procedure.
        - Implemented a built-in function that acquires run-time parameters.
        - The description language has been changed from the conventional Turbo Pascal Ver5.5 to Caveson itself.

    Ver 0.05    '91/03/21

        - Improved the code generator.
        - Part of the library was rewritten with assembler.
          - When defining a structural type function, the symbol indicating the return value of the function is not released.
              Fixed a bug.
          - Added a convolution function for constant calculation. As a result, such as a [3, 4]
              You don't have to do subscript calculations with array references.
          - Startup routine with code that temporarily releases the heap area at startup
              Added to. Previously it used the link's / cp: 1 option, so
              Eliminates the drawback of not being able to use the heap with linkers other than MS-LINK.

    Ver 0.06    '91/11/19

         - Improved the code generator of the expression.
         - Added inline expansion of binary search as an implementation of case statement.
             This method was taught by suto.
         - Added a range check option for partial range type.
         - Compatible with the assembler R86 attached to LSI C-86.

    Ver 0.07    '92/06/10

         - Improved the argument code. Changed to push variables directly.
         - Supported convolution of logical constant expressions.
         - You can improve the code of the for statement to efficiently execute a constant number of loops.
             Sea urchin.
         - Fixed a bug when using comparison operators in assignment statements.
         - Bug when declaring the procedure declared in the interface clause external
             Fixed.
         - Enabled global goto statement. It's a feature that was originally supported
             However, it could not be used due to a bug in Ver 0.06.
         - Fixed some bugs in the document. Along with this, the text format
             Changed data to FPLF.

    Ver 0.08    '93/01/04

        - Supported huge arrays.
        - Japanese can be used as an identifier. However, the Japanese identifier
            Since it is made into assembly code as it is without being converted to alphanumeric characters,
            If you don't use the one that can use Japanese identifier for the umbrella, you will use Japanese.
            No programming is possible.
        - Improved the code of the with statement.
        - Separate the error message from the compiler and separate file (cabezon.err)
            I tried to put it in.
        - Separate the declarations of built-in functions and procedures from the compiler and file them in a separate file.
            I put it in (cabezon.ini).
        - Error check when the string type definition exceeds 32 Kbytes
            I tried to do it.
        - In the built-in function paramStr, the execution path is returned when the argument 0 is given.
            Sea urchin.
        - Embedded functions bitshift, cpos, min, max, embedded procedure gettime, getdate
            Was added. The procedure for gettime and getdate was created by maquiwo.
            He is, and with his consent, I will add it as a standard library.
            It was. I would like to express my gratitude.
