1. Memory model
   Caveson generates the code for the large model.
   The code area is up to 1 Mbyte, but the code for one program or unit
The space limit is 64 Kbytes. Since the string constant is taken in the code area,
A program that displays a lot of character strings (text, adventure games, etc.)
Should also be usable.
   Static data can be up to 64K bytes. Stack area is 16K by default
Bytes, but can be expanded to 64K bytes with link-time options or EXEMOD
is.
   Also, in the huge array, the size of one element is up to 32K, and the number of elements is up to 32767.
If you meet the limitation, you can use up to the full conventional memory of MS-DOS.
I will.
   Since the pointer is 32 bits, the heap area is up to 1 Mbyte.

[Summary]

   Code         up to 1 Mbyte

? High address  +-------------------------------+

[Note]
   The "maximum 1 Mbyte" in the above table is the theoretical 8086 CPU.
It's the limit. Actually, it is used as an OS area or a user area like VRAM.
Consider that there are some parts that cannot be used and that there are resident programs such as FEP.
Then, think that the maximum is actually about 500K bytes.

3. Internal structure of data

3.1 Character type
   Character types and their subrange types are stored in memory as 1-byte unsigned numbers.
Su.

3.2 Logical type
   A boolean is 1 byte and can be considered a predefined enum as follows:
Su.

        boolean = (false, true)

3.3 Enumeration type
   Unsigned bytes if the number of enumerations is 256 or less, 2 bytes if the number is 257 or more
It is treated as a signed number of. The current Caveson handles 2-byte unsigned numbers
There is no function.

3.4 Integer type
   The integer type and its subrange type are stored in the following two types depending on the range of values.
To do.

(1) When it falls within the range of 0..255
   Stored as unsigned bytes.
(2) In other cases
   It is stored as a signed 16-bit integer.

3.5 real numbers
   The real format is the 8087 long word format, 64-bit.
It occupies the size of (8 bytes). This is almost the same as the IEEE double precision format
It seems to be the same.

3.6 pointer
   The pointer is 32 bits of segment + offset. On memory, offset
The lower word is the lower word, and the segment is the upper word.

3.7 string
   The character string occupies the maximum length of the character string + 2 bytes. 1 word of string (bytes
Is not) contains a number representing the current string length as a signed number.
Su.
   The maximum length of a string variable is approximately 32K bytes. It signs the length of the string
It depends on holding in numbers.

3.8 array
   An array is an array of element type variables.

3.8.1 Multidimensional array
   In a multidimensional array, the right dimension changes first.

[Example]

        array[1..3, 1..2] in the case of

        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
        | [1,1] | [1,2] | [2,1] | [2,2] | [3,1] | [3,2] |
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
        < Low address                      High address >

3.8.2 huge array
   A huge array can access more than 64K bytes. huge
In array index calculation, the first subscript is the calculation of segment address
Will be done. Therefore, when calculating subscripts, the element type of the huge array is a paragraph.
It is rounded up to the nearest (16 bytes).

        var
            a : huge array[1..10000, 1..30] of char;

   The element type of this array is array [1..30] of char (30 bytes), but in 16-byte units
It is rounded up to 32 bytes and subscripted.

3.9 record type
   Each field of the record is arranged according to the boundary value of the field type.
I will. The type boundary value is defined as follows.

        Type of type                         | Boundary alignment unit
        ------------------------------------ + ----------------------------------------------
        1-byte base type                     | 1 byte
        Integer type, real number type,      |
          pointer type                       | 2 bytes
        Structural type (excluding strings)  | Maximum number of element type boundary values
        string type                          | String element type boundary value

[Example]

        record
            a : boolean;    The offset of a is 0
            b : integer     The offset of b is 2 as a result of border alignment.
        end;

[Note]
  string[n] of char The boundary value of is 1.

  Packed records are not supported.


4. Stack frame

4.1 Procedure call procedure
   Procedures and functions are called in the following procedure.

a) Stack the return address of the function on the stack (only for functions that return a structural type)
b) Stack the argument value or address on the stack
c) Stack the static link value
d) Call the target function / procedure.

   On the other hand, the called procedure side enters and exits to maintain the stack frame.
Run the following code by mouth.

-Entrance-

        push    bp              ; bp = Save dynamic link
        mov     bp, sp          ; Create a new stack frame
        sub     sp, constant    ; Create an area for local variables

-Exit-

        mov     sp, bp          ; Fold the local variable area
        pop     bp              ; Erase stack frame
        ret     Parameter size + static link area
                                ; Retrieval of arguments and static links

[Note]

(1) About static links
   A static link is a variable of a procedure whose nested procedure is outside.
I also connected the addresses of the stack frames as a list to access
It is.
   However, for the outermost defined procedure, variables in the outer scope
Is a static variable only and does not require a stack frame. Therefore, the most
When calling a procedure defined outside, push the stack frame
I don't.
   Similarly, when returning from the outermost defined procedure, in the argument area
It will be erased only.

(2) About the return value of the function that returns the structural type
  Caveson has the ability to treat structural variables as expressions.
  Structured objects cannot be stored in registers, so instead
We have adopted the rule of pushing the dress onto the stack.
  When calling a function that returns a structural type (hereinafter referred to as a structural type function), the caller
Allocate an area for the return value of the structural type with and push the address. This area
Is on the stack in the current Caveson compiler.
  On the called function side, store the result value at that address and return.
However, at this time, the address indicating the result is not peeled off on the function side.
Because the address indicating the result remains on the stack, the result is
Because it is supposed to push the address of the structural type object.
  This property makes it very easy to call structured functions in multiple stages.


4.2 Distinguishing between near / far of functions and procedures
   In the code generated by the Caveson compiler, near is used to call functions and procedures.
Use both call and far call. These distinctions are made according to the following rules
I will.

        interface Functions / procedures described in the section  far call
        Other functions / procedures                               near call

4.3 Function result
   Here's how to return the result of a function:

1-byte order type       Store the result in the al register and return
2-byte order type       Store the result in the ax register and return
Pointer                 Stored in dx, ax (dx is a segment, ax is an offset)
Real number             Push results to the top of the 8087 stacké
Stereotype              Store the result at the address passed by the caller.
                         (Of the arrays and records, those with 1, 2 and 4 bytes are
                         Stored in a register. )

4.4 Saving registers
   Procedures and functions must store the following registers.

   Each register of bp sp ss ds


5. Register allocation
   Register allocation in the Caveson language is relatively simple.

ax: Accumulator
bx: Computation assistance (calculate after popping data to bx), static
           Stores the offset address of the indirect reference used when following the link
cx: Store the number of string instruction data
dx: Accumulator assistance (used for 32-bit data)

si: Stores offset addresses other than indirect references
di: Stores the address in combination with es for indirect reference.
bp: Refers to the stack frame
sp: Stack pointer

ds: Refers to a segment of static data (usually fixed)
es: Stores the segment part of the address when referencing or indirectly referencing a huge array.
ss: Stack area segment (fixed)
cs: Segment of code area (value changes with far-all)


6. Heap manager

6.1 What is a heap manager?
   In the Pascal language, the standard procedure new / dispose is used to determine the area pointed to by the pointer.
Secure A group of routines to support this function is called a heap manager.
is.

6.2 Operating principle of heap manager
   The principle of Caveson's heap manager is as follows.

(1) The heap area is empty in the initial state
(2) If the remaining amount of the heap is less than the memory allocation request, only 64 Kbytes
       Request memory from MS-DOS
(3) 64 Kbyte areas are connected by pointers.
(4) Inside the 64K byte area, free areas are connected in ascending order with pointers.
(5) new cuts out the required size from the area first found by the first fit method.
(6) When disposing, be sure to merge with the adjacent free space.

   With this method, new is reasonably fast, but dispose is fairly slow.
I will. On the other hand, there is no front header for the allocated area, so there is almost no memory waste.
There is none.
   In fact, the above features of the heap manager implement the Cabezon compiler.
It can be said that it is convenient. The Cabezon compiler no longer requires the area pointed to by the pointer
Then, do not dispose, manage it yourself, and use it for the next memory allocation
I will. So it's okay for dispose to be slow.


7. Link with assembly language
   The Caveson compiler has the ability to link with assembly language.
   In order to call assembly language functions / procedures from Pascal side, external
Use the declaration.

[Example]
        procedure asmRoutine(x, y : integer); external;

   This function / procedure can be placed in the interface part or not.
If placed in the interface section, it will be called with a far call. If not,
It is near. In both cases, declare public when defining in assembly language
Don't forget that.
   One more note is needed. Segment name and assembly language assumed on the Caveson side
If the segment names actually defined on the word side do not match, "fix" at link time
I get an "up overflow" error.
   The segment name assumed on the Caveson side is determined by the following rules.

  external Source file name where the declaration is placed + "_TEXT"

   For example, if the external declaration is stored in a file called abc.pas,
The segment name abc_TEXT will be assumed.

   Next, I will explain how to compile and link.
   Split compilation is also easy with the compiler driver cab.exe.
For example, Pascal source is a.pas and assembly language source is b.asm.
If the file name is

A>CAB A.PAS B.ASM       <- Specify .ASM

   Just type in. Now that B.ASM has been debugged and A.PAS is being debugged,
     he does not have to assemble B.ASM every time he compiles. In this case

A>CAB A.PAS B.OBJ       <- Specify .OBJ

If so, you can save waste.
   If you have a very large number of source files, we recommend using make.

that's all
